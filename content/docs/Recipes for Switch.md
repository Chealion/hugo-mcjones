# Recipes for Switch
The advantage is you can use immersion AND pour through as you want.

If you replace the cone with a V60 03 (bigger cone), you can do a larger amount.

## 4:6 Method (Tetsu Kasuya)
2016 V60 winning recipe. The tl;dr is 40% of the water in the first two pours, while the other 60% split up more. The first portion affects the brightness, while the second affects the body. See [their blog post](https://en.philocoffea.com/blogs/blog/coffee-brewing-method) on it.

40g coffee  
600g water

1. (00:00) Bloom with 100g, wait 45 seconds
2. (00:45) Add next pulse (140g), wait 45 seconds
3. (01:30) Add next pulse (120g), wait 45 seconds
4. (02:15) Add next pulse (120g), wait 45 seconds
5. (03:00) Add next pulse (120g), wait 45 seconds
6. (03:30) Remove

The basic is 5 x 120g pours
But tweak the pours slightly for sweetness (long second pour) or acidity (longer first pour).
Last 3 pours affect the strength of the coffee - 4 x 90 instead of 3 x120 can increase. 2 x 180 would reduce.

The advantage is you can use immersion AND pour through as you want and has become my daily driver at home - especially using a mix of immersion and pour over / pulse
## Generic 
16g coffee  
50g water, bloom for 30 seconds  
210g water (240 total)  
Let immerse 2 min. Hit switch at 2:30 and drain

If you replace the cone with a V60 03 (bigger cone), you can do a larger amount.

20g coffee  
300g water

Pour 150g with switch open

# Switch with Mugen Hack
## Background
I learned about using the Hario Mugen instead of the standard V60 cone with the Hario Switch from [CoffeeGeek](https://coffeegeek.com/guides/howtos/hario-mugen-switch-brewer-hack-how-to/).

The tl;dr for why is that with a no-bypass brewer it can be a lot easier to do things consistently when you can’t or won’t give pour over the attention you should.

## Testing
20g coffee  
240g water

1. Pour 40g. Wait 30 seconds to draw down and bloom
2. Close. Pour remaining 200g water.
3. Wait 60 seconds.
4. Open and let draw down.
## Reddit Recipes

## CoffeeGeek Recipe
1:20 ratio
