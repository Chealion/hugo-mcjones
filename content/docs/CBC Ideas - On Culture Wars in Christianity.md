# CBC Ideas - On Culture Wars in Christianity

06:00 - “culture war is internalized in religious communities when we are susceptible to what I'm gonna call ideological capture”
“ideological capture is when we become the sorts of people for whom we think what makes us who we are, our identity, is what we know, what we believe, the truths that we proclaim. But here's the piece that I think we often don't appreciate. I think it's also very, very, very important for us to be seen as the people who know those things.”

10:40 - “If we recover the thickness and almost the kinesthetic aspects of being a believer, ironically, we wouldn't think of it as just believing. It would be about loving and longing and desiring. And this is what the spiritual adventure is about.”

16:40 - “What I'm more interested in is then all of the religious folks and Christians who have to go through the work of rationalization of why they would then support this person who is utterly cynical about such things, I think, but they have to do a sort of internal rationalization in which they know this is symbolizing that this is someone who's going to fight for our interests.”

21:00 - “third way here is not just some brokered compromise between the two poles. Instead, the third way requires a kind of new level of consciousness and self-consciousness where we recognize ourselves anew because we can see ourselves locked in this polar mirror opposite wrangling. And in that sense, the third way recognizes the gifts and goods that each of the poles represent.”

23:21 - “I'm really intrigued by your suggestion, because in many ways, I think those moments of Jesus' discourse are the moments in which he's trying to implode our tendency to set up everything as binaries.”

The rest doesn’t fit with quotes but explores mysticism, exploring, and finding communion.

41:30 - “The question we should be asking ourselves in the midst of the culture wars is not what do you believe, what do you think, what do you know? It should be asking, what are we afraid of?”
