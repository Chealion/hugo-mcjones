# Governor Francis Sargent
“And there is this to remember as we begin: the risks we take come down to betting on ourselves. On people vs things, on people vs automobiles, on people vs the reckless destruction of our homes, our environment, the very quality of our lives all in the false name of progress. The only real progress is the progress of people. I don't think we can go wrong when we put our money on ourselves. I've counted on your help before and it's been there. I call upon you once again and I'm sure that you will answer that call.”
