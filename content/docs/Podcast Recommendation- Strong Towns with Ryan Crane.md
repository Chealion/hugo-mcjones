# Podcast Recommendation: Strong Towns with Ryan Crane
# The Strong Towns Podcast - Ryan Crane Malpractice and Accountability in Engineering - A Surgeon’s Take
https://overcast.fm/+qpp1zxIxs
https://podcast.strongtowns.org/e/ryan-crane-malpractice-and-accountability-in-engineering—a-surgeon-s-take/

## What I liked: 

Solid run down of safety and engineering. 

I really liked the bit about latent causes versus active causes as a different way of showing systemic vs human causes in safety
