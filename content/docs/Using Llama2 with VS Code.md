# Using Llama2 with VS Code
1. Download and install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/)
2. Have Ollama download and set up the codellama model: `ollama run codellama`
3. Download and install [Continue](https://continue.dev/) for VS Code
4. [Configure Continue to use Ollama](https://continue.dev/docs/walkthroughs/codellama) - make sure you restart/reload VS Code and check Continue’s selected model in the extension pane.
5. [Learn how to use Continue in VS Code](https://continue.dev/docs/how-to-use-continue)

## Using Continue
Open the Extension so it’s available as a pane. You can open it by using Command - M by default. (Which is not great)
