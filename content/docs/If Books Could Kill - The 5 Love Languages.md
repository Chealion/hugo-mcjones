# If Books Could Kill - The 5 Love Languages

I’ve always wondered about the veracity of this book after it was over recommended when I got married. There’s lots of little bits that are true, but so many things just gave off generic Christian / male centric takes on things. I never appreciated when I first read this in the late 2000s. The podcast highlights just how… fabricated this entire book actually is. And given the history of who wrote it - it fits.
