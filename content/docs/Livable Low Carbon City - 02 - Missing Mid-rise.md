# Livable Low Carbon City - 02 - Missing Mid-rise
I’m a huge fan of quality mid-rise to create the sustainable density and community.

“The issue with the focus on the missing middle is that it largely ignores;
a) how the economics of missing middle in cities with systemic housing shortages no longer work because land and construction costs are too high. And
b) the overwhelming land area in most of our cities is devoted to detached houses. The scale and speed in which we need to be adding houses to US cities, especially affordable housing will be incredibly difficult if not impossible to achieve with this outsized focus on small scale homes.
It also doesn’t address the lack of walkability or accessibility in most of these neighbourhoods. Nor does it address the egregious policy of  limiting affordable and social housing to our most toxic streets“
