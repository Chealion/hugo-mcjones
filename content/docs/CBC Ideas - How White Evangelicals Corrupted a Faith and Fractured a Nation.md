# CBC Ideas - How White Evangelicals Corrupted a Faith and Fractured a Nation

3:40 the only way to be a faithfulâ€¦

5:30 - Imperial US evangelicalism 
6:48 - the victim/persecution complex is fundamental to evangelicalism

24:00 - the undercurrent and basis for why white was used in the title. It was inherently racist and patriarchal despite its ability for folks of colour or women to use the church as an organization for good. Until it became inconvenient for the march towards taking power.
25:45 - the myth of colour blind Christians.
30:30- the efficacy of evangelicals at gate keeping and erasing history
