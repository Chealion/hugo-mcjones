# Day Two Cloud - 239 - (Almost) Every Infrastructure Decision I Endorse or Regret

Social media posts will tend negative, research will tend to suffer from survivorship bias. Be aware of the information’s limitations.

Approach things by knowing the problem you need to solve - don’t have a solution to find a problem.

This can lead to tool sprawl - documentation/golden paths help - but it’s a mistake to think of it this way. Complexity sprawl is a much bigger deal than tool sprawl - 3 smaller tools can work better than one much larger complicated tool.

The importance of being intentionally public - makes it easier to add folks who were missed and also makes it easier to see why decisions were made.

Tools are culture.

Approach gen AI like a search engine - requires skills to use it correctly and able to judge the results just like search results.

Incentives matter - if you don’t have incentives to prevent throwing things over the fence, you get pain.

Create a process only if it will solve a problem.

Manage the impacts of alerts.

The power of saying no. Articulate the consequences of saying yes.
