# Tech Lead Journal - 144 - Better Value Sooner Safer Happier - Jonathan Smart & Simon Rohrer

> “There is no playbook. There is no one size fits all. That’s why I like the words patterns and anti-patterns. Usually successful, usually less successful with the  anti-patterns. There is no playbook because every organization is unique. Because every organization is a complex adaptive system. Every organization has its own unique history and culture and incentives”

Value is at the heart but not at any cost.

If you want to do an agile transformation - don’t. Instead focus on outcomes. Beware the focus on a tool/process instead of the why.

“Better products faster” became “Better value sooner”

There must be an incentive. The flip side of incentive is a threat and not enough orgs remember this. You need to nurture psychological safety to minimize threat.

Change is only some process and mostly culture.

Role Model  
Psychological Safety  
Emergent Mindset - acknowledging the future is not knowable and to have hypothesis and test.
