# Tech Lead Journal 102 - Building Inspired & Empowered Product Teams - Marty Cagan
### Traits of Good Product Teams

1. Is the team given a problem to solve? (Not a feature to build)
2. Are they addressing the risks before or after? (Value, feasibility, usability, viability)
3. How do they solve the problems? (Product Design / Engineering side by side - not dictated or waterfall. Empowered engineers)
4. Outcomes not output

On Ownership & Alignment - points to Team Topologies.

Managerâ€™s responsibility is coaching.
