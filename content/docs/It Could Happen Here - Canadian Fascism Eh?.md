# It Could Happen Here - Canadian Fascism Eh?
A fantastic look at the state of the rise of the Canadian fascist elements as of Oct. 2021. This predated the Ottawa occupation by the Freedom Convoy that would come the following February. Unsurprisingly, many of the factions mentioned in these two podcast were involved in the Freedom Convoy. Some just as cover to make them more acceptable, others to see if they could overthrow the government.
