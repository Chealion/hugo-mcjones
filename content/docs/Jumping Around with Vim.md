# Jumping Around with Vim
A couple neat things I learned in Oct. 2023:

* `f` and `F` will jump the character on the line that you enter. Shift F will go backwards.
* `t` and `T` are similar but will put you one character in front of where you want go
* `gu` and `gU` - and number for lines to make upper or lower case.
