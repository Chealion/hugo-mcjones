# Strong Towns - Summary
## Podcast Info

## Thoughts
A pragmatic view of how to make a strong, resilient, and sustainable strong town. It scales up nicely for cities and down for villages as well. We should not be playing Ponzi schemes with our cities anymore - we have for far too long.

Upzoned is an excellent podcast but is a higher volume than the main podcast and focuses more on individual stories.
