# COMMONS - CULTS - Multilevel Marketing (Episode 7 and 8)
### Episode 7
* MLMs have moved from co-opting femnist and suffragist terminology to holistic, all nautral, non toxic, etc.
* Pseudo-religious experience
* Completely adjacent to the [prosperity gospel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosperity_theology) grift.
* The requirement for folks involved to only operate on hope and dreams.
* If you fail - it’s a character defect. If you succeed - then it’s part of the system. This is part of how it becomes a belief system.
### Episode 8

> Multilevel marketing isn’t based on rational business logic, it’s not even built on a irrational business logic. It’s ideology. It’s faith. It’s a particularly American form of faith. The Protestant ethic stripped away of even the pretensions of Christian charity.

* Amway’s DNA and creation is all prosperity theology and making the 99% set up to fail to feel shame and not blame Amway.
* To do fraud on an industrial scale you need a belief system, propaganda. Authoritarian control is a requirement
