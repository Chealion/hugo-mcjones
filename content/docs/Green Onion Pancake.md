# Green Onion Pancake
http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-scallion-pancakes-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-107405

## Ingredients
2 1/2 cups white flour (355 grams)  
1 cup warm water  
Oil for the pancakes, such as vegetable, sesame, or shortening  
Coarse kosher salt  
1 bunch scallions  
High smoke point oil for the pan, such as vegetable, canola, or peanut oil

## Directions
1. Make the dough and let it rest: Mix 2 1/2 cups flour with 1 cup water until it forms a smooth dough. 
2. Knead by doubling the dough over and pressing it down repeatedly, until the dough is even more smooth and very elastic. Coat this ball of dough lightly in oil and put it back in the bowl. 
3. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and let the dough rest for about 30 minutes.
4. Roll out the dough: Cut the dough into 4 equal parts.
5. Lightly oil the back of a large metal baking sheet (or a smooth stone countertop or pastry board).
6. Roll out one part of the dough on the back of the baking sheet. Roll until it is a thin rectangle at least 12 x 9 inches.
7. Finely chop the bunch of scallions. (I usually use the green tops and just the very top of the white parts.) Set them on your work surface along with a small bowl of kosher salt.
8. Top the dough: Lightly brush the top of the dough with (sesame) oil, then sprinkle it evenly with chopped scallions and kosher salt.
9. Roll up the dough: Starting from the long end, roll the dough up tightly, creating one long snake of rolled-up dough.
10. Cut in half: Cut the dough snake in two equal parts.
11. Coil the dough and let it rest: Take one of these halves and coil into a round dough bundle. Let it rest for at least 15 minutes and ideally longer, while you repeat this process with the rest of the dough.
12. Roll out the coil: Pat a coiled dough bundle into a flat, smooth, round pancake. You can do this with a rolling pin or with your hands.
13. Cook the pancake for 2 minutes: Heat a 10-inch heavy skillet or sauté pan over medium-high heat, and oil it with a drizzle of canola, vegetable, or peanut oil. When the oil shimmers, pick up the pancake dough and lay it gently in the pan. It should sizzle, but not burn. Cook for 2 minutes on one side.
14. Flip and cook for an additional 2 minutes: Flip the pancake over with a spatula and cook for an additional 2 minutes on the other side, or until golden brown. Repeat steps 9-11 with the rest of the pancake dough coils.

## To Serve

Cut the pancake into wedges with a pair of kitchen scissors, and serve immediately with soy sauce or another dipping sauce.
