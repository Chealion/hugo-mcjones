# Developing Leadership - Summary
## Podcast Info

## Thoughts

Developing Leadership is a great podcast looking at leadership decisions, skills, and other challenges.

At it’s best it helps with looking at how to build at a team, while at it’s worst it does highlight the tradeoffs requested between a company and a team of workers within our current system.
