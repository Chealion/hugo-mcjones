# Behind the Bastards - How The First Police Went From Gangsters, To An Army For The Rich
Clip lost to Twitter post Musk: https://twitter.com/Chealion/status/1304829288907067392

>  ~[@bastardspod](https://twitter.com/bastardspod)~’s episode on the history behind American policing gives a ton of clarity on many systemic undercurrents.

32:30 - “One of the most popular methods use today even, to justify the violence of the police is the supposed criminality or deviance of the people that the police are victimizing. It’s interesting to me that you can draw a direct line between the delegated vigilantism that started in the 1800s and the right wing reaction to the murder of Trayvon Martin” (Batman references not quoted because I’m too lazy to transcribe it completely)
