# Recipes for Japanese Style Iced Coffee

### Rule of Thumb
To accommodate the melting ice, use a hot water to coffee ratio:  
Chemex (ice in Chemex) 12:1  
Aeropress 10:1  
V60 13:1  
Kone 11:1

Grind finer than you would normally for hot.

### Eight Ounce Coffee
53g coffee  
(Roughly 1/3rd ice, 2/3 ice on the 15:1)  
235 grams ice  
560 grams water
