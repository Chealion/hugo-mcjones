# Evi Nemeth
It’s impossible to encapsulate all of Evi’s wisdom here, but these tenets have stuck with us:

* Be conservative in what you send and liberal in what you receive. (This tenet is also known as Postel’s Law, named in honor of Jon Postel, who served as Editor of the RFC series from 1969 until his death in 1998.)
* Be liberal in who you hire, but fire early.
* Don’t use weasel words.
* Undergraduates are the secret superpower.
* You can never use too much red ink.
* You don’t really understand something until you’ve implemented it.
* It’s always time for sushi.
* Be willing to try something twice.
* Always use sudo.
