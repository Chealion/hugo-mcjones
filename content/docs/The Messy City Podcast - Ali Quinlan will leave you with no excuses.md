# The Messy City Podcast - Ali Quinlan will leave you with no excuses
45 min mark - A great push back against the thinking that leads to: “here is this slot, here are the expectations and the needs of this slot and if you as a cog can not fit in this slot then I will find another cog”

50 min mark - they have a 3 strike miserable rule to fire a client because life is too short

50:48 - “We try to always return all this policy wonky, housing type conversations back to people. Because what we’re building is the framework for people to live in. To live their lives. To have their kids. To fall in love. To watch someone they love die. We’re building the environment and framework for life but it’s about life and it’s about people”

51:32 - “The more we can legalize life, the better we are doing. We are living in this environment where we have this very narrow definition - we are building housing for nuclear families that don’t exist anymore - in the majority. 

So, we’re limiting people’s ability to create these relationships, to make choices that make sense for them financially. *We are limiting people’s  lives and they don’t get to get those back.*

It can’t take us 40 years to fix this because we’ve lost an entire generation of lives.”
