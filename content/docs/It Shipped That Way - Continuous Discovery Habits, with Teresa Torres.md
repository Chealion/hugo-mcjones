# It Shipped That Way - Continuous Discovery Habits, with Teresa Torres
5:20 - the reminder to remember the context of the advice that comes out of FAANG companies and the survivorship bias intrinsic in it.

6:30 - focus on what leads to good decisions

8:45 - you have agency to change your habits even if the org is not interested.

12:00 - the book mentions a product trio - it should be read more as a set of five cross functional focuses - feasibility, usability/accessibility, viability, desirability, ethical. The team should cover and collaborate on all 5.

36:30 - “Have we developed our own practice and our point of view?” - something folks develop as they mature.

“And a lot of that is not having a step by step process. It's being willing to like react to what you're hearing back from that feedback loop and then matching the right tool based on what you're hearing.”

38:00 - References a quote from Daniel Kahneman - “The confidence people have in their beliefs is not a measure of the quality of evidence but of the coherence of the story that the mind has managed to construct.”

38:46 - “And I get to the very end, and one of the things he says at the end is, even knowing about these biases doesn't protect you from them.”

“Like even being aware of these biases, this is not how you overcome them because your brain will still construct a coherent story and it's gonna feel like truth. And I think this is a big reason why we need to do discovery together because somebody else can see your bias way better than you can”

40:00 - folks believe their fast system 1 response. Asking more helps shows the reality with a system 2 response and pulls away some of the biases.

“if we interview people asking where our questions don't get around that filter, we're gonna build products that people aspire to use, but don't use. In fact, gyms, their whole business model is based on this.”

“I think the challenge is, we're aspiring to live to a standard. We literally wouldn't hold another human being to, right? And so we have to understand that, and then we have to ask questions that counteract that.”
