# CBC Ideas - The North Star: Canada and the Civil War Plots Against Lincoln by Julian Sher

A fantastic trip through the story of how much Montreal was used as a safe haven during the Civil War, how happy Canada was to profit off of the Civil War, and just how much Canadian elites like Sir John A MacDonald supported the South.

We (Canada) has blood on our hands and we love the fantasy that we donâ€™t.

Counter intuitively we have the Daughters of the Confederacy for their memorialization to remind us how party Canada was to the civil war and classism.
