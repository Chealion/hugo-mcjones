# Overcast -> Bear Shortcut
The shortcut I use to send a particularly good episode to Bear has the following steps:

Take the info from Overcast and put into a new Bear note. I then copy some text to the clipboard and add that text to the Bear note because Shortcuts has some really weird bugs that prevents me from adding it.

It can be checked out at https://mcjones.ca/downloads/Overcast%20To%20Bear%20.shortcut.zip
