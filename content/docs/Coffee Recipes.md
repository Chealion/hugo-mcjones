# Coffee Recipes
## Rules of Thumb
Base Ratio is 16 g water to 1 g water  
Chemex - 15.6:1  
Aeropress - 13:1  
V60 - 17:1
## Baratza Settings
The gotcha is that it's tweakable for your taste and the coffee in question. You have to get good at identifying under (sour, weak, empty) and over (bitter, strong, empty) extraction. If done right, we'll see sweetness, clarity (notes of the coffee are evident), acidity, finish

AeroPress - 12  
V60 - 15  
Kone - 16
Chemex - 20  
Work Chemex - 24

## Random Coffee Notes
Beans are 28% by weight water soluble.

Sour, Light, Weak = too coarse
Bitter, Harsh, = too fine
