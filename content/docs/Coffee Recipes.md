# Coffee Recipes
## Rules of Thumb
Base Ratio is 16 g water to 1 g water  
Chemex - 15.6:1  
Aeropress - 13:1  
V60 - 17:1

## Baratza Settings
The gotcha is that it's tweakable for your taste and the coffee in question. You have to get good at identifying under (sour, weak, empty) and over (bitter, strong, empty) extraction. If done right, we'll see sweetness, clarity (notes of the coffee are evident), acidity, finish

AeroPress - 12  
V60 - 15  
Kone - 18  
Chemex - 20  
Work Chemex - 24

## Japanese Style Iced Coffee

### Rule of Thumb
To accommodate the melting ice, use a hot water to coffee ratio:  
Chemex (ice in Chemex) 12:1  
Aeropress 10:1  
V60 13:1  
Kone 11:1

Grind finer than you would normally for hot.

## Hario Switch
The advantage is you can use immersion AND pour through as you want and has become my daily driver at home - especially using a mix of immersion and pour over / pulse

### My Go To
This process mimics the 4:6 method by splitting the pours into roughly 4 “pulses”/stages.

30g coffee
450g water

Fill with 100g water and let bloom for 30 seconds.
Fill to 150g water and let sit for an another 30 seconds.
Open and let pour down.
Close and add 100g more water (250g total)
Open and let pour down.
Close and add 100g more water (350g total)
Open and let pour down.
Close and add 100g more water (450g total)
Open and let pour down.

### Generic 
16g coffee  
50g water, bloom for 30 seconds  
210g water (240 total)  
Let immerse 2 min. Hit switch at 2:30 and drain

If you replace the cone with a V60 03 (bigger cone), you can do a larger amount.

### Eight Ounce Coffee
20g coffee  
60g water, let steep 1 minute  
Drain  
Close, 40g water (100g total), open  
Close, 50g water (150g total), open  
Close, 50g water (200g total), open  
Close, 100g water (300g total), open  

Total brew time is 4-5 minutes.

375g total liquid - 125g of ice into your brewing vessel, 250g hot water

Alt for the cubes at home.
33g coffee
540g liquid = 180g ice, 360 hot water

Rinse filter + preheat switch over the sink.

Bloom with 45-50g water for 45 second. Switch up.  
Add rest of liquid (~200 grams to reach total of 250 grams)

Swirl vessel after full drawn down.

## Mix of Immersion and Pour Over

Pour slowly the next 260g as normal for a v60
