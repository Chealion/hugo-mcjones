## Monica Interview
I struggled with the bit of needing to talk to the other side when marginalized. Requiring the emotional labour from victims even if we are talking to those less oppositional *feels* big. Reinforcing that talking to everyone and not letting yourself fall into a bubble might be the bigger deal.
