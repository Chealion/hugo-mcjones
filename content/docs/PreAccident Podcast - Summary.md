# PreAccident Podcast - Summary
## Podcast Info
https://preaccidentpodcast.podbean.com/
## Thoughts
This was first recommended by Jeff Lindsay (https://mas.to/@progrium) on Twitter quite a few years ago and I listened for a few years.

Todd Conklin does an excellent job looking at various items on how to better improve safety and how it overlaps with so many industries.

The overlap between IT, and safety specialists in their particular fields - wether it is medical, aerospace, or other is incredibly informational - especially when you look at the pre-accidental view.

I unfortunately had not saved/starred many of the really good episodes from the years I listened before dropping it to try and reduce the number of new episodes I was listening to.
