# The War on Cars - Fixing America's Car Culture with David Zipper

This is a banger full of really good sound bites.

5 min mark:
> “At some point, you have to make a choice of whether it’s more important to save lives or to facilitate fast car traffic.”

* 85th percentile, right on red, parking minimums. All “feels rightish” starting points that have proven to be key to the negative reinforcement cycles in safety on roads.

15:40:
> “due to some federal regulations like the CAFE loophole that allowed SUVs to be treated as light trucks, and there are some other federal rules, but a lot of that is due to the car companies trying to figure out how to make more money from a given sale. SUVs and trucks are more expensive and more profitable than smaller cars, sedans and station wagons. That is a big part of it.”

* Zipper’s article from 2022 noting just how much worse the growing size of vehicles is for anyone not in a vehicle: https://slate.com/business/2022/11/suv-size-truck-bloat-pedestrian-deaths.html

* Interesting public sector actions:
  * speed governors on the public fleet can cause a noticeable impact in average speed when non emergency vehicles can’t speed.
  * Weight based car fees
