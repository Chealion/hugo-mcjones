# Tech Lead Journal - 105 - Coaching for Technical Leaders - Bob Galen
The summary is that technical leaders need to be aware they need to hone their coaching skills/competencies

The book/interview looks at something called the agile coaching growth wheel (a superset of professional coaching). Which is more about stances or coaching skills to look for needing to do:

* Professional coaching - asking questions, especially open ended questions
* Mentoring - partnering/apprenticeship
* Training/Teaching - directing with knowledge
* Guided Learning
* Facilitating
* Advising / Consulting / Directing

There’s a time for questions there’s a time for mentorship there’s a time for direction.

Reminder that the posture change of what can we do to help and listen makes a meaningful difference.

Powerful Questions are great but there are so many. [The Coaching Habit](https://boxofcrayons.com/the-coaching-habit/) simplifies it to 7.

1. “What’s on your mind?”
2. “And what else?”
3. “What’s the real challenge here for you?”
4. “What do you (really) want (from me)?”
5. “How can I help?”
6. “If you’re saying yes to this, what are you saying no to?”
7. “What was most useful for you?”

How is “Powerful Listening” different than “Active Listening”?

Nothing mentioned seems to say if they’re different or if it is a different term for the same thing - listening to truly learn.

Create your own percent rule - you should help your team more than direct/provide a solution. Something I am bad at.
