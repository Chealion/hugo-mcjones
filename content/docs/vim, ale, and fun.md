# vim, ale, and fun
## ale

Asynchronous Lint Engine

Ale is a fantastic syntax checker for vim and neovim and has made my life a lot easier.

## Toggling ale on and off
However there are many times I just want it to shut up so I can read the file in questionâ€¦

```
:ALEToggle
:ALEDisable
:ALEEnable
```

## Customizing Ale
There are two use cases that Ale drives me nuts because while fantastic defaults I run into issues where they cause issues:

* Spell check
```
:set nospell
```


<!-- #public #vim #ale -->

<!-- {BearID:C1AF76CB-8BB5-44E7-A9EF-F8DD1580A388} -->
