# Coffee Recipes - Hario Switch
The advantage is you can use immersion AND pour through as you want.

If you replace the cone with a V60 03 (bigger cone), you can do a larger amount.

## Hario
16g coffee  
50g water, bloom for 30 seconds  
210g water (240 total)  
Let immerse 2 min. Hit switch at 2:30 and drain

References the 4:6 method he also came up with.

## 4:6 Method (Tetsu Kasuya)
2016 V60 winning recipe

40g coffee
600g water

1. (00:00) Bloom with 100g, wait 45 seconds
2. (00:45) Add next pulse (140g), wait 45 seconds
3. (01:30) Add next pulse (120g), wait 45 seconds
4. (02:15) Add next pulse (120g), wait 45 seconds
5. (03:00) Add next pulse (120g), wait 45 seconds
6. (03:30) Remove

The basic is 5 x 120g pours
But tweak the pours slightly for sweetness (long second pour) or acidity (longer first pour).
Last 3 pours affect the strength of the coffee - 4 x 90 instead of 3 x120 can increase. 2 x 180 would reduce.
