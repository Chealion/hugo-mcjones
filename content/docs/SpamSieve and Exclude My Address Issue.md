# SpamSieve and Exclude My Address Issue
Source: https://forum.c-command.com/t/address-book-exclude-my-address-just-isnt-working/10879/7

1. Double check what addresses SpamSieve is getting from Contacts: Go to x-spamsieve://default?k=LogAddressBook&v=YES
2. Quit and reopen SpamSieve and open the Log
3. In my case it wasnâ€™t seeing ANY of the emails from my contact card.

The fix?
