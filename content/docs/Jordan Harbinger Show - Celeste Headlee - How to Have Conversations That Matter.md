# Jordan Harbinger Show - Celeste Headlee - How to Have Conversations That Matter
One of my most enjoyed episodes of this podcast:

33 min - empathy is how you address bias
35 min - try daily - donâ€™t leave a conversation until you learn something
42 min - stop entering conversations trying to change minds. Ask questions.

Ask - Why do they believe what they believe?
