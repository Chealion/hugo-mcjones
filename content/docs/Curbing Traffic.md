# Curbing Traffic
Melissa Bruntlett and Chris Bruntlett

## Quotes
“It’s about refusing to sacrifice vast amounts of the public realm to the private automobile; instead reserving space for commerce, community, and social connection. The ubiquitous bicycles are simply a by-product of that larger process; a tool to achieve the end goal of what policy makers call an autoluw (low car or nearly car free) city.”
P.4


## Points
* Roads make our cities archipelagos - a series of islands.
