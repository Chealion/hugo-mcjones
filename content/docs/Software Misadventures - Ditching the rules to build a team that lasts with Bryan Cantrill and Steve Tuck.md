# Software Misadventures - Ditching the rules to build a team that lasts with Bryan Cantrill and Steve Tuck

Honest, in depth look at making curious teams that last and the importance of not letting yourself myopically only looking at one portion of a business.

Why to ask someoneâ€™s happiest time in interviews, and the importance of folks empowered by helping others. That gratification and validation is not only at promotion time.

The importance of transparency - how open meetings and recorded meetings can help with that.
