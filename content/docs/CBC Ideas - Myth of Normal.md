# CBC Ideas - Myth of Normal
Part 2 - around 3 minutes:

> Neurodiversity is the recognition that human beings have different kinds of brains, different ways of thinking, different ways of experiencing the world, different ways of experiencing the five senses,  and that our world is better for it. … Neurodiversity increases the strength and resilience of human communities by bringing different ways of thinking and problem solving together.”

Part 2 - around 29 minutes: 

> The damage that’s done is born of the misunderstanding, the flat out ignorance on the part of the general public where they’re still stuck in the smart, stupid dichotomy in terms of ranking minds. It’s such a crude and misleading metric
