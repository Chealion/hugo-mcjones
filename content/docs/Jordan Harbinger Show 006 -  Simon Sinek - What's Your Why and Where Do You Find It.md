# Jordan Harbinger Show 006 -  Simon Sinek - What's Your Why and Where Do You Find It?
17 min - you can incentivize behaviour.  Not performance
35 min - don’t conflate your status with the status of rank

Cliche - but finding / defining a purpose. 

I’d recommend watching his TED talks instead of the full interview: https://www.ted.com/speakers/simon_sinek
