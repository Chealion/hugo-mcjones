# CBC Ideas - Mercury's In Retrograde - The Rise of Astrology
I had not realized how much more popular astrology had become.

It’s a placebo at best, and ripe for abuse as the horoscopes push consumer behaviour. It does this under a veil of objectiveness that’s not based in reality. It might be better if it was pseudo-scientific instead of a mechanism that preys on a human’s ego.

The 20-25 minute mark hilight how folks are seduced by the vague descriptions.
