### 4:6 Method (Tetsu Kasuya)
2016 V60 winning recipe. The tl;dr is 40% of the water in the first two pours, while the other 60% split up more. The first portion affects the brightness, while the second affects the body. See [their blog post](https://en.philocoffea.com/blogs/blog/coffee-brewing-method) on it.

40g coffee  
600g water

1. (00:00) Bloom with 100g, wait 45 seconds
2. (00:45) Add next pulse (140g), wait 45 seconds
3. (01:30) Add next pulse (120g), wait 45 seconds
4. (02:15) Add next pulse (120g), wait 45 seconds
5. (03:00) Add next pulse (120g), wait 45 seconds
6. (03:30) Remove

The basic is 5 x 120g pours
But tweak the pours slightly for sweetness (long second pour) or acidity (longer first pour).
Last 3 pours affect the strength of the coffee - 4 x 90 instead of 3 x120 can increase. 2 x 180 would reduce.
