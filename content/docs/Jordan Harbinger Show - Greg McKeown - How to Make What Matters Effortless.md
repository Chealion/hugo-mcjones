# Jordan Harbinger Show - Greg McKeown - How to Make What Matters Effortless
Summarizing that effort is finite. When effort = results starts to fail - what next?

Easy != lazy

How do we make it effortless?
But more - who is it for? What does done look like? What’s the simplest way to achieve it?
Over complicating or over thinking things is easy to do. It makes it overwhelming to even get started.

Come back to what does done look like?

1. What does done look like?
2. What steps can I delete?
	Can I streamline? Or what if we could start from 0?
3. What is the obvious first action?
4. What gradual pace can I sustain?
5. What can I be grateful for?

My note - if step 3 and 4 happen it feels obvious and easy. Or they never happen.

41 min mark - complexity builds over time. Don’t hesitate to revisit from 0.

Focus on what you want more of
Remember we are not machines. We are biological and rhythmic.
For some that means a done for the day list, and not a to do list.
Try after complaining to add something you are thankful for.
