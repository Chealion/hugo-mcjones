# CBC Ideas - Sometimes I think this city is trying to kill me

Robin shared his journey in real time on Twitter. It was part of what educated me on the need to be engaged, on the need to push for designs for people. Additionally his exploration on how urban design decides the scraps we argue to get a piece of.

Sadly, this history and threads are yet another little piece that we lost with the destruction of Twitter by a petulant billionaire.

08:12 - “the city is a medical intervention”  
09:30 - debate quote. Resources are finite.  
10:30 - they have a budget and it’s turned into a healthcare budget and the police are major sources of that we’re sitting our cities up the field   
11:00 a shared understanding of a single organism,  
￼19:15 - urban planning is political act that verifiably causes harm. This is why it’s so important our politicians represent everyone.  
22:15 - the importance of understanding that we are the environment for others. We affect others.￼ whether or not you want to believe it.  
26:35 - cars are the major source for noise pollution in major cities.  
27:49 - “Sometimes I think the city is trying to kill me”  
32:35 - part of what makes nature so healing is the drastically smaller amount of task demands - navigating cars, police (Robin is a PoC)  
37:04 - you can not dream, when you can not sleep.
