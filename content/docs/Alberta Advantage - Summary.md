# Alberta Advantage - Summary
## Podcast Info

## Thoughts

At first itâ€™s a left wing centric perspective on various Albertan and Canadian topics, but as it goes on it becomes incredibly important political education for what is truly left versus Neo-liberal, centrist, and conservative values.

While it is very Alberta and Canada centric, it is a fantastic resource for political education to better understand actual leftist ideas compared to what 2010/2020s society pretends is a leftist idea.
